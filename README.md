# 2DTDGame

This is a 2D game that blends the genres of tower defence with true rouge-like (perma death with no persistant upgrades). The game looks to be a heacy skill driven game with unlockables aiding the player as they continue to get better.

## Towers/Buildings
These are some of the towers that are in the game:
### In Game
 - Turret
 
   - The turret is the most basic of all tower, it shoots (wow).
 - Base
 
   - This is the player in all sence. If the base goes down, the player goes down, defend it with your life 'literally'.

## Cards
Cards will be the main upgrade path for the player. Cards are upgrades that can be attached to towers in game that provide bonus' for that session only and will be gone upon death. There will be a variety of uses for these cards and will provide interesting gameplay techniques for the player.
